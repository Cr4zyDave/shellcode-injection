# Shellcode Injection in CPP (Because WHY NOT?)

### Why You Should Use This
- **You’re a Cybersecurity Guru**: Maybe you’re deep into penetration testing or malware research. Maybe you just like to mess with stuff and see what breaks. Either way, this code will *definitely* teach you something useful—or at the very least, it’ll give you a good laugh while you try to figure out why everything stopped working.

- **You Like Risk**: You know what they say, "No risk, no reward." So why not inject shellcode into a process and see what happens? Sure, it could destroy your system or make your antivirus software throw a tantrum, but that’s all part of the fun.

- **You Have Absolutely No Idea What You’re Doing**: That’s right—this project is for people who *might* know C++ but don’t really know what shellcode injection is. And guess what? That’s totally fine! You’ll learn as you go (or you might break something. No promises either way).
